## Ising Model
The basic introduction about Ising Model can be reviewed in my blog "[Study note about Ising model](https://huijiaoluo.github.io/2024/07/16/QuantumNote1/)". Before reviewing the codes, it is better to understand the content in the blog first, since the background of Ising model will be helpful to understand the logic of the codes.

Codes about Ising Modeling by Monte Carlo approach can be checked in: 
1. ***Simple_1DIsingModel.ipynb***
2. ***Simple_2DIsingModel.ipynb***
3. ***2DIsing_ConfigurationVisualization.ipynb***
